<h1>SHATAP MELON</h1>
<p>shatap melon on 07/28/2025 is a moment of all time where the user remyx was called slow by melon, causing remyx to go into "crybaby mode" so then remyx said "shatap melon", melon wasnt affected by this and instead used the "crybaby mode" to their advantage by getting all the ENFPs on the server to start imitating remyx's iconic "shatap melon".</p>
